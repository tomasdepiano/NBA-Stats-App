### Bugs

One bug that I couldn't figure out is when you click on "Edit a Player" or "Remove a Player" the modals don't show up on the center on the screen but on the left side of the page.

### Future Development

I would like to add a clip of each player most famous highlight on this app at some point and fix the bug with the modals not showing up on the center of the screen.
