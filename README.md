## Description

If efficiency is how you play then you're at the right place! I often find myself spending more time preparing to play Destiny rather than playing it. There is so much to do and so little time ðŸ˜ž.

### Client

Here you can describe what creates your front end (react using Vite) and highlight bits of code you're proud of [future build](#future-development).

#### Feature I Like

Why I liked it an how it works

<!-- this is how you make coding snippets -->

```js
const localSeasonalChallenges = seasonalChallenges.map((week) => {
  // * Set weekName to be JSON and LocalStorage Friendly
  const weekName = week.name.replaceAll(" ", "-");
  // * If a Given Week is Not In Local Storage, Save to LocalStorage
  if (localStorage.getItem(weekName) === null) {
    localStorage.setItem(weekName, JSON.stringify(week.challenges));
  }
  // * If a Challenges are Added to As Week, add Them To LocalStorage without Deleting User Data
  const localData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(weekName));
  const serverData = week.challenges;
  // ** Checks if Server has new data by comparing the it's length to LocalStorage
  if (serverData.length > localData.length) {
    // *** Start Loop with the length of LocalStorage, since we would already have those indexes saved with user data and we do not want to overwrite them with default values
    //  // Loop through the length of the server data and push any new data at index [i]
    for (let i = localData.length; i < serverData.length; i++) {
      localData.push(serverData[i]);
    }
    // *** Save Updated Data to Local Storage
    localStorage.setItem(weekName, JSON.stringify(localData));
  }

  // * For a Given Week, map() Through Each Challenge, Programmatically Create Data, and Sync Data In Local Storage
  week.challenges.map((challenge, challengeIndex) => {
    // *** Create belongsTo string
    challenge.belongsTo = weekName;
    // *** Create challengeIndex Number
    challenge.challengeIndex = challengeIndex;
    // *** Use getLocal to Sync Completed Data
    challenge.completed = getLocal(weekName, challengeIndex, true);
    // ** For a Given Challenge, map() Through Each Objective and Sync Data in Local Storage
    challenge.objectives.map((objective, objectiveIndex) => {
      // *** Use getLocal to Sync Data
      objective.completed = getLocal(
        weekName,
        challengeIndex,
        false,
        objectiveIndex,
        true
      );
      objective.progress = getLocal(
        weekName,
        challengeIndex,
        false,
        objectiveIndex,
        false
      );
      // *** Return Updated Data
      return objective;
    });
    // *** Return Updated Data
    return challenge;
  });
  // console.log({week});
  localStorage.setItem(weekName, JSON.stringify(week.challenges));
  // *** Return Updated Data
  return week;
});
